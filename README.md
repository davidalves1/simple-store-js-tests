# Simple Store JS Tests

A simple store application to apply the lessons of the JS Tests course.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To run the development server, you can use one of the following commands:

`npm run dev` or `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev`

Then, open <http://localhost:3000> with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [next/font](https://github.com/vercel/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-font) to automatically optimize and load [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter), a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
